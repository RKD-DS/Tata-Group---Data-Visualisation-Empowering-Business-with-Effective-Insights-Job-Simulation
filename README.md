# Tata-Group---Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights-Job-Simulation

**Project Description:**  

I completed the **Tata Data Visualization Virtual Experience** on Forage, where I gained hands-on practice analyzing real-world datasets and creating impactful visualizations to communicate insights. This simulation involved interpreting data, designing clear visual narratives, and presenting findings in a business context. Through tasks like data cleaning, dashboard creation, and storytelling with charts/graphs, I strengthened my ability to transform complex data into actionable recommendations.  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Visualization tools (e.g., charts, graphs, dashboards)  
- Storytelling with data  
- Business-focused insights presentation  

This repository documents my solutions and key takeaways from the program. Check out the files to see how I approached data-driven problem-solving!
